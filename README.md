# extract_cabled_receiver_data
Program for extracting detections from Vemco VR2W receivers.

Vemco VR2W receivers output a lot of data in their logs, and it can take a lot of time to parse each daily file
for detections over a long period of time. This program takes in the raw log files and puts them in an appropriate
database format.
